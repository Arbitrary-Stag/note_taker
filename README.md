## Description
This is the ninth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to build the backend of a note taker app. The front end code was provided by the bootcamp, and we were required to utilize Node.js, express, and to deploy the completed app through Heroku.

## Installation 
To use this app simply navigate to the app by following the deploymenet link address. No additional instsallation is required.  

## Usage
Once the user has navigated to the apps deployment link address, they will be greeted by a landing page with a button that prompts them to begin. On the next page that loads, if the user has previously saved any notes they will be visible on the left hand side in a column. By clicking on any of these buttons the saved note will be displayed in the main field. The user also has the option to delete an old note by clicking on the trash can icon next to the saved note in the column. If the user wishes to create a new note they need to simply give the note a title, and some information in the text field below and click the save icon in the upper right corner of the page.
